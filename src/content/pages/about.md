After an unsuccessful attempt at freelancing, I started out as an frontend engineer building dashboards in Angular at a startup focused on dairy tech. Picked up some infra responsibilities while working there. Joined Procedure in 2019 as the 13th employee, and I've been here since then. The current headcount is around 50.  
Feel free to reach out at **sreeraj@theprocedure.in** for more deets.

I like to run and hike in my free time and sometimes contribute to open-source repositories. I do some freelancing, mostly DevOps consulting or as a technical advisor. I've worked with Turtlemint, Treebo, Indiagold and Setu as a consulting backend engineer in my time with Procedure. Developed a HIPAA compliant k8s backed infra for an inhouse "medtech" product.
