I currently work at **[Medley Learning](https://medleylearning.com)**, building a platform for students to bridge the gap.

Before Medley, I spent 6 years as a consultant at **Procedure**, working with 0-1, mid-stage, and late-stage startups across Fintech, Hospitality, and Tech domains. I've worked with Turtlemint, Treebo, Indiagold, and Setu as a consulting backend engineer, and developed a HIPAA-compliant Kubernetes-backed infrastructure for an in-house medtech product.

I started out as a frontend engineer building dashboards in Angular at a dairy tech startup, picked up infra responsibilities, and joined Procedure in 2019 as the 13th employee.

I like to run and hike in my free time and sometimes contribute to open-source repositories.

Feel free to reach out at **contact [at] sreeraj [dot] dev**.
